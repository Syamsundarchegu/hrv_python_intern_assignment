# Project Name
hrv_python_intern_assignment

## Description
This project implements a Python script designed for log file analysis. It processes web server logs to extract valuable insights, such as:

Count of Requests per IP Address: The script parses log entries to determine how many requests were made by each IP address, displaying the most active ones in descending order.

Most Frequently Accessed Endpoint: It identifies which resource or endpoint was accessed the most based on the log data.

Suspicious Activity Detection: The script is also equipped to detect potential brute force login attempts by monitoring failed login attempts (HTTP status 401 or specific failure messages). It flags IP addresses with excessive failed attempts beyond a configurable threshold, indicating potential security concerns.
